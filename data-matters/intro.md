# Data Matters

:::{admonition} Preamble
:class: warning
N.b., these are my opinions and not representative of those of my employer. This (these) posts are simply to memorialize some of the things that I’ve learned in an informative manner (for my own uses/devices). While I hope you find them useful, they’re not official statements of any kind. 

This 'book' is my personal blog, of sorts, and is dedicated to working through some technical thoughts, musings, etc. Nothing fancy here, just good 'ole fashioned prose and math.

## Who am I? 
As a data scientist and entrepreneur, I have a proven track record of transforming new ideas into real world innovations. Which is cool, I guess, but I'm really more interested prosing out some technical thoughts and ideas for my own personal amusement/recollection. 

If you're really interested in seeing a review of me, check my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eli-goldberg/).  

## Why should you care? 
Great question. You shouldn't, probably. However, some of the things I discuss/explore here may be of use/interest to you in your career (or just for fun). 

## Organization
Organizing my thoughts is a pain. It's already pulling teeth to get them into a format that other folks can understand. Thus, I want to keep the organization simple. I'll do my best to create some meta-organization of my posts, but there's no guarantee. However, on the left hand side I'll try to organize my musings into 'buckets' that lump together similar-type 'stuff'... no promises though.
